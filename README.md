# About

This little gig was born as a solution to an assignment on a relatively overpriced C++ course that I decided on taking.
I found it pretty nice and decided to share it here. Someone may enjoy it.
I hope you do.

## Make

This project uses [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/). The Makefile has four targets:

* `build` compiles the source code and generates an executable
* `format` applies [ClangFormat](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html) to style the source code
* `debug` compiles the source code and generates an executable, including debugging symbols
* `clean` deletes the `build/` directory, including all of the build artifacts

## Instructions

1. Build the project: `make build`

2. Run the resulting executable: `./build/monitor`

3. Monitor _everything_.

4. Even have some fun while doing it...
